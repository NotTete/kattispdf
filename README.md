# KattisPDF

KattisPDF is a Python library and tool that allows to convert problem statements from [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) to pdf.

## Installation

To install KattisPDF just use `pip`:

```
pip install kattispdf
```

It is necessary to install a LaTeX processor such as [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/). As [PyLaTeX](https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX/tree/master) is used and it needs `pdflatex` or `latexmk` (Recommended) to create the pdf.

### Linux
`latexmk` is available in almost every package manager. Search it on your favourite package manager.
### Windows
In order to use`latexmk` in Windows you need to install `perl`.

```
# If you have pearl install you can omit this
winget install "Strawberry Pearl" 
```
```
winget install MiKTeX
```
Once you are done reboot your device.
## How to use
KattisPDF includes a CLI tool `kpdf` to download the problems automaticly, but it can also be used in a python script.
### CLI Tool
```
kpdf problem-id -o path/to/output
```
### Python Script
```python
import kattispdf

problem_id = "alchemy101"
kattispdf.generate_pdf(problem_id)
```
